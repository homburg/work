## üîß Development

### File-Based Routing

This project uses [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction) with file-based routing. You can start developing by editing files inside the **app** directory:

```
app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (tabs)/          # Tab-based layout
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ +not-found.tsx   # 404 page
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _layout.tsx      # Root layout
```

### Navigation Structure

The app uses bottom tab navigation with:
- **React Navigation 7** for tab management
- **Expo Router** for file-based routing
- **Deep linking** support built-in

### Native Features

The application includes several native integrations:
- **Haptic feedback** for user interactions
- **Blur effects** for modern UI
- **System UI** controls for status bar
- **Gesture handling** for smooth interactions
- **WebView** for embedded web content

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
